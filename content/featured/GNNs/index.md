Graphical Neural Networks (GNNs) see a noticeable drop in performance with increasing depth unlike neural networks which show improvement in performance with increasing layers. We systematically investigated the reasons behind the drop in accuracy by testing methods to reduce oversmoothing in GNNs while leveraging Cora and PubMed datasets.
